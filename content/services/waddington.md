# Site
- Waddington Avenue is a bungalow with a rear garden measuring approximately 45m long by 16m wide
- The area of the site for the new houses is approximately 697m2
- The site is located within the London Borough of Croydon
- Topographically, the site is on a gradient which broadly falls from west to east
- The siteâ€™s frontage overlooks an area flanked by houses
- The Site is not in a Flood Zone or within any area of heritage protection
# Acquisition
- We identified the site through our internal direct sourcing processes
- Agreed purchase with the Vendor being conditional on obtaining planning approval for residential development of the site
- Because of the purchase being conditional on planning, we were able to agree with the Vendor a price above market value
# Finance
- Given the purchase is subject to planning permission, there is no upfront cash outlay to purchase the site
- Red Banksia incurs all costs associated with obtaining planning permission to develop the site. These costs are paid solely by Red Banksia, with no cost to the Vendor
- We will explore our opportunities to develop the site using development finance when the outcome of our planning application is known
# Planning
Demolition of the existing dwelling and redevelopment of the site to provide three two-bedroom houses, two-bedroom houses, and one three-bedroom house all with accommodation within the roof space with associated refuse and cycle provision and landscaping.
