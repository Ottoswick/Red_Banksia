# Site
- The site area is approximately 0.102 acres  or 413m2
- Located within the London Borough of Croydon
- The land is currently built on with a detached house, a garage separate from the main building, and has a large garden that wraps around the detached house
- The site is not in a Flood Zone or within any area of heritage protection
# Acquisition
- We identified the site through our internal direct sourcing processes
- Agreed purchase with the Vendor being conditional on obtaining planning approval for residential development of the site
- Because of the purchase being conditional on planning, we were able to agree with the Vendor a price above market value
# Finance
- Given the purchase is subject to planning permission, there is no upfront cash outlay to purchase the site
- Red Banksia incurs all costs associated with obtaining planning permission to develop the site. These costs are paid solely by Red Banksia, with no cost to the Vendor
- We will explore our opportunities to develop the site using development finance when the outcome of our planning application is known
# Planning
Demolition of the existing dwelling and redevelopment of the site to provide a terrace of five two-storey, three-bedroom houses with accommodation within the roof space with associated refuse and cycle provision and landscaping.
