# Site
- The land is currently built on with a detached house comprising multiple extensions and conservatories. It has a large garden to the rear and parking court to the front
- The total area of the site is approximately 765m2
- Topographically, the site is on a gentle gradient which broadly falls from east to west
- The site is not in a Flood Zone or within any area of heritage protection
# Acquisition
- The site was identified through our internal direct sourcing processes
- Agreed purchase with the Vendor being conditional on obtaining planning approval for residential development of the site
- Because of the purchase being conditional on planning, we were able to agree with the Vendor a price above market value
# Finance
- Given the purchase is subject to planning permission, there is no upfront cash outlay to purchase the site
- Red Banksia incurs all costs associated with obtaining planning permission to develop the site. These costs are paid solely by Red Banksia, with no cost to the Vendor
- We will explore our opportunities to develop the site using development finance when the outcome of our planning application is known
# Planning
Demolition of the existing dwelling and redevelopment of the site to provide nine flats in a four storey building with associated landscaping, parking, cycle storage and amenity space.
