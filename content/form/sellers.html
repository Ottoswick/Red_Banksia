<p>We are a residential property developer that provides high-quality homes to places that need them most. We believe in building beautiful homes that communities deserve.</p>
<p>When looking for a development site, we start with you, the homeowner. We want to talk to you about your plans and see if we can help you achieve, or hopefully surpass, your sale target. We have a track record of beating current market values by 10-20% when purchasing a site.</p>

<h1>Recent Projects</h1>
<p>Below are some recent projects of ours. These aren't the only two purchases we have made in this way, we do it quite a lot. Are you interested in selling, but not in a particular hurry? Fill in the form below and find out how much we would offer on your property.</p>

<h2>Coleridge Road, CR0 7BT</h2>
<p>The owner had a valuation come back on their property at &pound;425,000 just before their neighbour sold their house (with a slightly smaller garden but the same type of house) for &pound;410,000. We ended up agreeing to purchase the property for &pound;550,000. That's 29% above what the owner had expected; he was thrilled.</p>
<h2>Linnet Close, CR 8PZ</h2>
<p>The house is a five-bedroom property that could have benefitted from some modernising. Local agents assessed its value &pound;500,000 to &pound;525,000. After reviewing our plans, we agreed to purchase the home for &pound;600,00 - 17% above the market value. These aren't the only two purchases we have made in this way, we do it quite a lot. Are you interested in selling, but not in a particular hurry? Get in touch and find out how much we would offer on your property.</p>
