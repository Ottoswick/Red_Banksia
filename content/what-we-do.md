# Maximise property potential

Through our internal planning department and project accounting team, we optimise the market value of property. Through this process, we work with property owners to agree on a contract for the purchase of their property (or a portion of their property) which is typically above the current market price and is subject to our team pursuing development approval from the local council. Examples in our current projects are [Court](/services/court/) and [Adolphus](/services/riesco/).
