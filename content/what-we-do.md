# We maximise property potential

Our internal planning and accounting team optimise the market value of property by identifying the development potential in residential and commercial properties. Through this process, we work with property owners to agree on a contract for the purchase of their property (or a portion of it) which is typically above the current market price and is subject to our team pursuing development approval from the local council.

See our Projects page for some examples of what we have done.

# Why work with us?

Property owners: we know you will only sell to us, or partner with us, if we generate more money for you than an estate agent sale would.

Investors: we know you will only work with us is if we generate more value for you than your other options.

Our in house planning expert and seasoned developer will lead each project and explain our approach to you.
