# Maximise property potential

Through our internal planning department and project accounting team, we optimise the market value of property. Our team enable clients to realise not just the current market value of their property but also to identify it's development potential.

This is always subject to the geographic area, local council and planning restrictions. However, our planning experts are able to navigate this process for our clients and realise the best possible outcome.

Through this process we work with property owners to agree a contract for the purchase of their property which is typically above the current market price and is subject to our team pursing development approval from the local council. Examples in our current projects are for [Court](/services/court/) and [Adolphus](/services/riesco/).
