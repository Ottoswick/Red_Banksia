# Optimise residential market value

Through our internal planning department and project accounting team, we can optimise the sale of your existing residential property. Our team will enable clients to realise not just the current market value of their property, but identity properties that have development potential.

Through this process, we work with home owners to agree an “Options Contract” for the purchase of their property. This contract will enable Red Banksia to offer above the current market price for the property, but this is price increase is subject to our team pursing development approval from the local council.
The cost of the planning and all legal fees are incurred by Red Banksia; our clients do not have to pay any expense.

This option is very beneficial to home owners who wish to realise a higher market value for the sale of their property and are not in a rush to move.

# Off-market sourcing, planning and development

Red Banksia have an extensive research and sourcing team that can assess existing land or unused space for future development. This may be large unused garden space, dormant garages or small properties that reside on very big plots of land.
Our team can assess possible development sites and then engage with home owners. This is usually through one of our targeting mailing campaigns, via our website or through online marketing.

Owners of dormant land are then able to engage directly with Red Banksia to realise development opportunities. In many cases, Red Banksia can assess the future development potential and offer a competitive market price. This is always subject to the geographic area, local council and planning restrictions. However, our planning experts are able to navigate this process for our clients and realise the best possible outcome.

This option is best for clients who don’t use the existing space of large plots like gardens, garages or out buildings.

# Client promotional contracts

In some unique cases, client may have so many development options for their residential property that it is difficult to predict the development potential. In these circumstances, Red Banksia can pursue a promotional contract with select clients.
This means Red Banksia and our clients form a “Promotional Agreement” to pursue residential development planning together. This is common for properties that may be suitable for transformation into many flats, apartment blocks or commercial premises.

This type of contract would enable clients to realise maximum future development for their property. This offering is best suited to clients who have large plots of land or an existing commercial premise.
