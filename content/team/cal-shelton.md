Cal is a chartered accountant and ensures the ﬁnancial assessment of each site is grounded in reliable real world ﬁgures. Cal will talk to local agents prior to starting any ﬁnancial appraisal so that his appraisals are underpinned by local knowledge in order to prepare detailed asset assessments, including site valuations and ﬁnancial forecasts based on the proposed development enabling us to make the best possible offer to buy the site.
